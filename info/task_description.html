    <p>The three robots reach the bottom of the pyramid and search for more clues. Sofia finds a small bit of text
        carved into the side of the wall.</p>

    <p>“Hey, check this out.”</p>

    <p>Nikola takes a look. “It’s hieroglyphics of some sort.”</p>

    <p>“No, wait, it’s some kind of equation.” Says Sofia. “ a + b + c ≤ N. I wonder what it means.”</p>

    <p>“Well, clearly we need to solve the equation.” Piped Stephen “Hangon, there’s another thing over here. It says
        ‘turn around and take __ steps to find the lost treasure of the Librarian.’ Wonder what that means...”</p>

    <p> “THERE’S A SECRET TREASURE?! NOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT!!” shouted Sofia at the top of her vocalizer</p>
    </p>“If we can figure out all the answers, maybe it’ll give us the number of paces we need to take.”</p>
    <p> “let’s do this.”</p>
</div>

<p>You are given four positive integers: A, B, C, N.
    If <span style="white-space: nowrap;">0 ≤ a ≤ A</span> , <span style="white-space: nowrap;">0 ≤ b ≤ B</span>
    <span style="white-space: nowrap;">and 0 ≤ c ≤ C</span>, using these integers you
    should try to calculate the number of possible solutions to the following equation: <span style="white-space: nowrap;">a + b + c ≤ N.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A list of four integers: A, B, C, N.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> An integer.
